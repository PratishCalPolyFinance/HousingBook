# State of Housing: Unpacking Vacancy and Affordability  

## About This Repository  
Welcome to **State of Housing**, a collection of articles that challenge conventional wisdom about homelessness and affordable housing. This is a heavy topic, so I try to bring some lighthearted commentary to the conversation—because if we can’t laugh at the absurdity of housing policy, we might just cry instead.  

My goal is to use data to shed light on the current state of housing policy in America. I focus primarily on California—not just because I live here, but because I’m deeply familiar with its housing data (and let’s be honest, if there’s a housing policy mistake to be made, California has probably already made it).  

## What You’ll Find Here  
- **Data-driven articles** exploring the mismatch between housing supply and demand  
- **Visualizations & maps** illustrating vacant homes vs. housing needs  
- **Policy deep dives** on solutions like government leasing, Proposition M, and Section 8 reform  
- **Occasional sarcasm** because, let’s face it, housing policy can be ridiculous  

## Why This Matters  
With a PhD in real estate finance from the University of California at Berkeley, a textbook in progress, and a passion for making complex policy issues accessible, I aim to spark fresh conversations about housing solutions. If you enjoy housing debates, bad zoning laws, or just a good paradox, you’re in the right place.
